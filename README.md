# Algorithms Visualizer :bar_chart:
> Everyone's done it and so shall I!

Everyone seems to have an algorithm visualizer in their portfolio, and for **good** reason. My aim with this long-term project is to develop a collection of algorithms in order to display both my understanding of them, as well as grow and demonstrate my skills with C++.

### Dependencies :bookmark_tabs: :

This project will be done using the SDL library. Most specifically I'll be using :
- ***SDL2***
- ***SDL2_text***
