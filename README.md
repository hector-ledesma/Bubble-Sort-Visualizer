# Bubble Sort Visualizer :bar_chart

In order to learn how interfaces are built and expand my knowledge of C++, I built this project. Running this code will launch a small window that will display what the bubble sort algorithm looks like in action.

### Dependencies :bookmark_tabs: :

This project will be done using the SDL library. Most specifically I'll be using :
- ***SDL2***
- ***SDL2_text***
